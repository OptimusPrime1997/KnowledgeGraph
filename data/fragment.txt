Klenow Fragment||Just as the 5' → 3' exonuclease activity of DNA polymerase I from _E.coli_ canbe undesirable, the 3' → 5' exonuclease activity of Klenow fragment can alsobe undesirable for certain applications. This problem can be overcome byintroducing mutations in the gene that encodes Klenow. This results in formsof the enzyme being expressed that retain 5' → 3' polymerase activity, butlack any exonuclease activity (5' → 3' or 3' → 5'). This form of the enzyme iscalled the **exo- Klenow fragment**.
