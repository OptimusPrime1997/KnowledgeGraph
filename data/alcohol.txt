Benzyl alcohol||Benzyl alcohol is used as a general solvent for inks, waxes, shellacs, paints,lacquers, and epoxy resin coatings. Thus it can be used in paint strippers,especially when combined with compatible viscosity enhancers to encourage themixture to cling to painted surfaces. It is a precursor to a variety ofesters, used in the soap, perfume, and flavor industries. It is also used ine-liquid for e-cigarettes to enhance the flavors used. When applied to damagedskin or mucous membranes at a 10% concentration it acts as a local anestheticand antimicrobial agent, and is sometimes included as a degreaser in rugcleaning products. As a dye solvent, it enhances the process of dying wool,nylon, and leather. It also has use as a photographic developer, and as aninsect repellent.
Coniferyl alcohol||A first dirigent protein was discovered in _Forsythia intermedia_. Thisprotein has been found to direct the stereoselective biosynthesis of(+)-pinoresinol from coniferyl alcohol monomers. Recently, a second,enantiocomplementary dirigent protein was identified in _Arabidopsis thaliana_, which directs enantioselective synthesis of (âˆ’)-pinoresinol.
Salicyl alcohol||**Salicyl alcohol**  is precursor of salicylic acid and isformed from salicin by enzymatic hydrolysis by Salicyl-alcohol beta-D-glucosyltransferase or by acid hydrolysis.
